***Disclaimer:*** This is not a real company as we know this is a dataset compiled by Dahel Consultant Techies for Internship purposes. 


## Introduction

This is a global fire-power analysis. It is done by analyzing data from  the Global Firepower table which comprises of 50 fields. I used Excel to get an overview of the dataset before importing it into Tableau where the actual analysis was carried out. 

## Problem Statement

The goal of this analysis is to know:

- The country with the most index power
- The country with the highest railway infrastructure coverage
- The country with the highest budget allocated by the country for defense and military expenditures.
- The country with the most energy self-sufficiency
- The continent with the most Aircraft strength compared to other continents.
- The most populated continent
- The country with the most active military personnel compared to other countries.
  
## Skills and Concepts Demonstrated:

- Tableau concepts like:

  - Data Connection:Connecting to various data sources such as Excel files, CSV files
  - Data Preparation: Cleaning and transforming data using Tableau, Handling missing values, data type conversions, and other data cleaning tasks.
    Creating calculated fields to derive new insights or perform calculations on the data.
  - Data Visualization: Building visualizations such as bar charts, bubble chart, scatter plots, heat maps, treemaps, histograms, and more to represent data. Using dual-axis charts, and 
    stacked charts to compare multiple measures or dimensions effectively. Applying filters, parameters, and sets to interactively explore and drill down into data subsets.
  - Dashboard Creation: Designing interactive dashboards by combining multiple visualizations, filters, and other elements onto a single canvas. Adding interactivity to dashboards using 
    actions, filters, and highlight actions to facilitate exploration and analysis. Optimizing dashboard layout and design for clarity and usability.
  - Advanced Analytics: Performing statistical analysis within Tableau using built-in functions and capabilities (e.g., trend lines, reference lines, forecasting). Conducting spatial 
    analysis by visualizing geographic data and using spatial calculations. Utilizing clustering, regression analysis, and other advanced analytics techniques for deeper insights.
  - Mapping: Creating maps to visualize geographic data using built-in geographic roles or custom latitude-longitude data. Customizing maps with various map layers, backgrounds, and map 
    styles. Using spatial analysis tools to perform geographic analysis and create spatial visualizations.
  - Calculations and Expressions: Writing calculated fields and calculated measures using Tableau's formula language to perform complex calculations. Using table calculations to compute 
    values based on the data displayed in a visualization. Implementing level of detail (LOD) expressions to control the granularity of calculations.
  - Data Exploration and Interactivity: Enabling interactivity in visualizations by allowing users to filter, highlight, and drill down into data dynamically. Utilizing tooltips, 
    parameter actions, and dashboard actions to enhance user experience and provide context-sensitive information. Implementing quick table calculations, sorting, and ranking to explore 
    data trends and patterns.

  ## Data Source:
  
The dataset for the work is gotten from Dahel Consultant Techies. It consists of 141 records and 50 fields of data. I studied the dataset well to gain proper insight into the dataset. You can find a link to download the dataset [here:](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FQoGRARMXfT0m0RPWop1EvgVhf5oT_yT/view?usp=sharing)

## Data Transformation:

**Step 1:**
- The first row is represented as column headers (field names).

**Step 2:**   
- Some certain data types were changed to values in the data source.

**Step 3:**
- Data derived from an Excel merged cell is changed to value in the data source.

**Step 4:**				
- Data is ignored and not included as part of your data source.

## Data Analysis and Visualization:

Several expressions and functions were made to arrive at the desired KPI or Metrics.
I arrived at a report with a single dashboard consisting of different visuals such as bar chart, doughnut chart, stacked bouble chart, and KPIs, giving the summary of the insights gained into the global power-fire status.

## Features of the Report:

The dashboard conveys information about the following key areas:

- country with the most index power
- country with the highest railway infrastructure coverage
- country with the highest budget allocated by the country for defense and military expenditures.
- country with the most energy self-sufficiency
- continent with the most Aircraft strength compared to other continents.
- The most populated continent
- country with the most active military personnel compared to other countries.

## Analysis

Summary of the insights gained into the chess Game performance: 

- Afghanistan has the highest Power index indicating that it has the lowest
military strength.

- Argentina has the highest railway infrastructure coverage within the country.
 
- Australia has the highest budget allocated by the country for defense and
military expenditures.

- Argentina country produces more quantity of oil indicating energy self-
sufficiency than every other country used in this Analysis.

- The Asia Continent has more Aircraft strength compared to other continents.
 
- The Oceania Continent has the highest budget allocated by the country for
defense and military expenditures.

- The Asia Continent is more populated than any other continent.

- Algeria has more Active Military personnel compared to other countries.
  
## Recommendation

- Leverage international partnerships to address security challenges given Afghanistan's
highest Power Index.

- Capitalize on Argentina’s extensive railway coverage for enhanced logistical capabilities.
- Invest Australia’s highest defense budget in cutting-edge military technologies and
modernization.

- Utilize Argentina’s significant oil production for economic growth and strategic advantages.
- Foster collaboration among Asian countries for joint defense initiatives, leveraging
superior aircraft strength.

- Prioritize military capabilities in Oceania by strategic allocation of the highest defense
budget.

- Address demographic challenges in populous Asia through sustainable development
policies.

- Strategically modernize Algeria's armed forces, leveraging its substantial active military
personnel.
